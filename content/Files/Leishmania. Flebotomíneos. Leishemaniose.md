# Conceitos
* Anergia;
# Visceral 
>Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by a single-celled parasite called _Leishmania donovani_ which is transmitted through the bites of female sand flies (_Phlebotomus_ spp.)
> Sand flies are difficult to control — they are smaller than mosquitoes, virtually silent and do not require water to lay their eggs.
